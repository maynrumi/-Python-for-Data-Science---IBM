# -Python-for-Data-Science---IBM

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python:
The primary programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook:
Likely used for running the code and documenting the process, given the nature of the code snippets provided.
Pandas:
Utilized for data manipulation and analysis:
Loading data from CSV files (pd.read_csv)
Creating DataFrames (pd.DataFrame)
Data analysis (describe(), info(), head(), shape)
Data cleaning (checking for missing values with isnull())
NumPy:
Used for numerical operations and array manipulations:
Creating arrays (np.array)
Basic arithmetic operations on arrays (a+10)
Matplotlib:
Employed for data visualization:
Creating pie charts (plt.pie) to visualize the distribution of diabetic vs. non-diabetic outcomes.
Seaborn:
Mentioned for potential use in visualization, although specific functions weren't shown, it's often used alongside Matplotlib for more statistical plots.
Requests:
For fetching data from URLs (requests.get for downloading files).
BeautifulSoup:
Used for web scraping, although not explicitly shown in the diabetes dataset analysis part, it's referenced in the broader context of data extraction.
JSON:
For handling JSON formatted data, used in examples of reading and writing JSON.

Concepts and Methods Learned:
Data Extraction:
Downloading data from the internet using APIs or direct URL requests.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Handling missing data, although in this dataset there were no missing values.
Understanding data types and ensuring they are in the correct format.
Data Analysis:
Descriptive statistics (describe() method).
Basic data exploration using .head(), .shape, and .info().
Data Visualization:
Creating charts to interpret data visually, specifically pie charts for categorical data.
Web Scraping (General Knowledge):
Using BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and extract information from web pages.
API Interaction:
Interacting with APIs to fetch real-time data (e.g., NBA data, RandomUser API).
File Handling:
Reading from and writing to files like CSV, JSON, and potentially XLSX.
Basic Python Syntax:
Functions, loops, conditional statements, list comprehensions, and dictionary manipulations.
Exception Handling:
Basic error handling in Python to deal with data operations or API calls.
DataFrame Operations:
Slicing, indexing, and manipulating data within pandas DataFrames.
